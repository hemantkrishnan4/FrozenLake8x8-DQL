# FrozenLake8x8-DQL

FrozenLake8x8-DQL is an improved reinforcement learning project that applies Deep Q-Learning to the FrozenLake 8x8 environment using PyTorch. The project utilizes a neural network to learn a policy that allows an agent to successfully navigate the larger FrozenLake map.

## Gymnasium Reinforcement Learning

FrozenLake8x8-DQL is part of the Gymnasium Reinforcement Learning collection, a set of Python code that solves Reinforcement Learning environments from the Gymnasium Library, formerly OpenAIâ€™s Gym library.

## Introduction

This project extends the original FrozenLake-DQL project to the larger 8x8 environment, providing a more challenging scenario for reinforcement learning. The agent learns to make decisions by interacting with the environment, and the training process involves updating a neural network based on experiences gained during exploration.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before running the project:

- Python (>=3.6)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FrozenLake8x8-DQL.git
   cd FrozenLake8x8-DQL
   ```

## Usage

To train the agent:
```bash
python main.py --is_training=True --render=False
```
To test the agent:
```bash
python main.py --is_training=False --render=True
```
